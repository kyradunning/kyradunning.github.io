## Overview of Portfolio
With the creation of this portfolio I hope to display my passion in exploring all aspects of the concepts I have been learning over the past few years. Through each project, I would like to showcase my programming skills in Python, Java and HTML/CSS, as well as my ability to fetch real-time data from APIs, and use other relevant libraries in real-world applications.
I expect to develop new management and organisation insights throughout the long-term creation and compilation of this portfolio, which I believe will also assist in continuously improving and creating a strong portfolio for future recruiters.

## Overview of Projects

### 1. Weather App

This project aims to showcase my Python skills, as well as my ability to implement real-time data extracted from APIs. The Weather App uses the '[requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/)' module in Python to make API requests to the '[Open Weather](https://rapidapi.com/worldapi/api/open-weather13/)' service
